# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by algorithmic patterns and difficulty levels.

## 🚀 Our Goal & Approach

The core goal of this repository is to offer **clear, effective solutions** to LeetCode challenges, serving as a stepping stone to master the fundamental **algorithmic patterns**.

### 🧠 Deepening Understanding & Debugging

**To accelerate your learning journey and understand the code's mechanics, consider these powerful techniques:**

* **Manual Trace (Toy Example):** Walk through the solution code step-by-step using a small, custom input. This provides immediate insight into the logic and flow.
* **Leverage the Debugger:** Step-by-step debugging is the most efficient method to observe exactly how variables change and where the program's control flow leads.
* **Pattern Focus:** Identify the underlying algorithmic pattern (e.g., Backtracking, Two Pointers, Dynamic Programming). Reviewing the general approach for that pattern will significantly enhance comprehension.
